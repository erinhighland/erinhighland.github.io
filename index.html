        <h2> The Easiest Form of Procrastination</h2>

          <p class="description">Possibly the most terrifying word in the English language : procrastination. It is the kryponite of success. We are all crippled by procrastinating, but it so easy to fall victim.  <a href="https://medium.com/@ehighland1244/the-easiest-form-of-procrastination-cb014506fe36">Every time I find myself behind on a dealine, I am usually distracted by one thing. </a>. </p>

    <h2>A Podcast about Podcasts</h2>

    <p class="description"> I would describe myself to be an avid podcast listener. I average around two or three podcasts listened to a day. For a long time however, I was adament about my dislike for them. The switch from a hater to a fan interested me, and I do not think I realized how difficult podcasting really is until <a href="https://soundcloud.com/erin-highland-934715003/podcast-for-digtital-media"> I tried it myself</a>. </p>

  <h2>How To Get Your Life Together In One Day</h2>

  <p class="description">I am utterly ashamed to admit how lackadaisical my academic performance has been this semester. When I realized how quickly the end of the semester was approaching and how much I still had left to do, <a href="https://youtu.be/pmYcnLygJf4">I totally panicked.</a>. </p>

            <h2>Laziness Does Not Exist</h2>

            <p class="description">This semester was the first time in my life I ever genuinely struggled academically. I was convinced I would never fix the disaster I created, that was until I read <a href="https://humanparts.medium.com/laziness-does-not-exist-3af27e312d01"> this article</a>. Devon Price is a social psychologist professor, he is also the author of "Laziness Does Not Exsist". His basis of his book was this article, and I have it to thank for pulling me out of a major slump. </p>
